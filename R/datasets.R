#' FACAT Data
#' 
#' This dataset contains various behavioral and fMRI measures from the FACAT study. 
#' FACAT is a category learning in which participants learned the underlying
#' category structure of blended faces. Some faces shared perceptual features - i.e. 50% blends - that
#' were relevant to the category structure, some faces shared perceptual features that were
#' irrelevant to the category structure, some faces shared no perceptual features. Included in the
#' dataset are the results from a representational similarity analysis looking at the item-level representations
#' and category-level representations.

#' DICAT Data
#' 
#' DICAT is a really boring category learning task. The behavioral results are not included in this dataset.
#' This dataset contains the correlations between the prototype / exemplar model fits and certain brain regions,
#' during final test runs 1 - 4 and the average correlations across the 4 test runs.
